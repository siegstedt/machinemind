You listen to the sound of the waves craching into the shore. You feel the sand under your bare feet. A dream of a remote work place. Though, is it secure? And if there was a secure remote work place, how can I set it up on my machine?

## Connecting to the internet through VPN

If you're lost somewhere in the bug city jungle and need to work from a Starbucks, you probably already know this: connecting to a public Wi-Fi hotspot.

While that can be convenient at times, it can also carry the risk of being exposed to potential threat. So, better protect yourself from connecting through untrustworthy Wi-Fi hotspots.

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet (see article on [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn)).

VPN connections are widely operated in Enterprise IT and garantuee that no matter where the employee is hovering, the device holds a shielded connection to the mothership. So by default, you should be covered if your IT department is doing their job. 

If you're a freelancer or an entrepreneur, better get a VPN software on your device to make sure that your connection is safe.

## Scanning files with antivirus software

No matter how well-protected your internet connection may be, if you download malware through a safe VPN tunnel, it is still malware.

Which is why you should shield yourself from malicious files coming in.

Again, a company's IT department would take care of such issues and get your devices equipped from day one. Though, if you're setting up a system yourself, be mindful about the potential that downloaded files may carry a virus.

Definitely, there is a ton of antivirus software out there in the wild. While I cannot recommend you using a particular vendor, I can simply encourage you to do your research, seek for consultation and get yourself equipped with a state-of-the-art solution.

## Use end-to-end encrypted messaging

Now that you are ready to access the internet and protected yourself from malware, let's reach out to the world.

If you don't mind that your messages - be it emailing, short messaging, etc - can be exposed to some provider scanning your texts, you can go with any of the mainstream, free vendors.

For more protection of your data, be aware of the providers that don't have a genuine interest in your data, but your security. Disclaimer: most of such secure services do not come for free.

But, the come with the necessary tech stack to encrypt your messages. As one of the most proiment fetaures, end-to-end encryption transmits data where only the sender and receiver can read messages.

Make sure that at least such up-to-date security protocols are in place and make it a standard for your email, or messaging apps.

## Share files securely

Well, once you get into conversations with people, you quickly find yourself searching for ways how to share files. We want to do that in a secure way as well.

Again, I don't want to call out providers of cloud or sharing services. Yet, I want you to be aware about the vendors that are leading the scene with their security features and promote data privacy - other than those who merely expose themselves as security laggards and private data miners.

Thus, check for vendors whose main focus is on privacy and security. Services should include some extend of cloud storage, online backup and sharing service. Strong providers would make claims that not even they themselves can access your files.

For instance, for cloud storage service, some use encryption to add an extra layer of security to backed-up files.

## Analog security

So far, we have only regarded security in the digital realm. But, as you are sitting in your favourite beach bar typing away your sensitive emails, there may be some concerns to security issues in your real world environment.

First, make sure to get your devices locked. Be it a password lock, fingerprint lock, face identification, or even a physical lock - you know, the basic security stuff.

Secondly, check your environment for shoulder surfers. People are curious. That's okay. It is what it is. Just get a seat where you feel safe, and get a anti-spy/glare film for your screen.

## Final thoughts

There is a Buddhist saying I really like. It goes.

```
"It is easier to put on a pair of shoes than to wrap the earth in leather." (Ch√∂gyam Trungpa)
```

What I'm trying to convey is, make sure to move safely. But don't overdo it either.
