## Effective computation in Physics (Huff, Scopatz)

"Getting started", "Getting it done", "Getting it right", "Getting it out there". These are the three sections of the book. It covers the full package of programming in Python. Mind that it has keeps the academical research context as a back drop. But that would not harm aspiring Data Professionals at all. Super recommend that book!
