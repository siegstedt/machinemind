To install Hugo on your machine, follow the instruction on the following link: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/ Now the playing begins. For getting started, it actually only takes a hand full of commands in your terminal. Again, Hugo really works most efficiently when used straight from the terminal. Here are the two (!) commands for creating a new site and navigating into its directory. hugo new site machinemind cd machinemind The site for sure still needs a bit more love and style. Let’s choose a theme. Hugo offers a big a variety of themes that you can download, apply on your site and change as you wish. Here is an overview: https://themes.gohugo.io/ For my site, I want to go with the LoveIt. Check out the documentation of the theme of your choice to make sure that you configure it correctly. For me, installing the theme is done with two git commands. git init git submodule add https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt.git themes/LoveIt Again, I want to highlight that the theme of your choice may require some changes to the config file of your site. For the basic setup of my site, I followed the instructions of the LoveIt documentation: https://hugoloveit.com/theme-documentation-basics/ So far, the page is free of any content. Here is the command to create a new post. hugo new posts/new-post.md The quickest way to edit the content of the post is for sure to simply open the markdown file in a text editor of your choice and hit some keys.

In this time of rapid innovation and the need for expert knowledge, it’s a tough call to be a master in all disciplines. Be it algorithm designs, project management, product design, you name it. It’s truly hard to span an umbrella to cover it all and still make it simple to follow through and produce effective results. Here is what I’d do: Blend Data Science into Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a repeatable and scalable process for innovation. It is meant for designing products in a human-centered way. Typically, the Design Thinking flow starts within the problem space where one seeks to understand and frame the user’s perspective of the problem. With a well-defined problem statement, Design Thinkers brainstorm on how to solve it before the flow continues into the solution space. In that space, it’s all about prototyping and playing back the output to the user to receive feedback. In Data Science, typically algorithms are trained to iteratively learn from data. This process is called Machine Learning and allows machines to find insights with or without explicit instruction where to look for the same. A project for applying Machine Learning typically starts with a problem definition, some provided data and a manual solution. After a exploratory data analysis, a Data Scientist would start to prepare the data so that it can be used for a selected algorithm to work on it. Based on the evaluation of results, the algorithm can be tuned. To recap, Design Thinking is a human-centered process that focuses on the problem of users and can be applied to solve any fuzzy problem. Data Science is a data-centered discipline that is home to any domain (or problem space) and uses methods such as Machine Learning to solve decision-making tasks carried out by a computer. Now that we understand that the one has it’s strength in the problem space and the other in the solution space, let’s bring the two together. The diagram below provides an overview of a process that flows through five stages allowing for iterations and repetition.

The Setup is centered around picking up an opportunity, assemble the crew and calling out the direction where to go. A good opportunity might be a process that consists of small, repetitive tasks that are not too complicated for a human to do once but tough to repeat at high volume and high precision. There maybe an experienced / specialized person doing the job manually. And that is the start of most of our use cases. Too often we expect humans to work like assembly line robots. And we do not create systems to assist the humans so that they can unfold their creative and social capacities.

Hold your keyboards still though – this is a non-coding area. First, one tries to zoom out and discover the full complexity and explore depth of the challenge at hand. In an effort to empathize with the user, you can hold interviews with customers, business units and teams. You can also look into some data begin to understand the flow of information and decision-making. As you want to bring your observations into structure, you define the problem. This might seam odd because you’d assume to know the problem. Yet, practice shows that a thorough discovery may bring to light new insights that are often reason to redefine or refine the initial understanding of the problem. So, how might we turn this into knowledge into a new product? Let’s ideate and envision a new future. In this step, you can run crazy and be truly creative. Tools such as value proposition canvases can help to structure crazy ideas into abstract product prototypes. For data-centered work, you may use a canvases with similar themes, e.g. ML / DL canvas.

Actually, this step may be placed at any start, respectively end of a space / loop. It ensures that you are not wasting your time and take decisions. Because, you should be be hard on your project and rather stop it sooner than later. Get your team together and pessimistically ask yourselves why this might fail and only keep going once all (technical) objections are met with a reasonable clue. If the team is happy with the project, give the project a go and let it pass to the subsequent stage. This decision should not be taking lightly. Ask yourselves whether you are really still fulfilling against the aspired vision. If you want to abandon the previous efforts to make a concerted effort towards a new option or idea, pivot the process. Lessons may be learned from the old project, and parts may be salvaged and re-purposed.

Finally, we can start hammering our fingers on the keyboards to produce ML code. Before you start building any system, invest a little time into planning out the sprints and translate the prototypes into a backlog of user stories. Get your ML model up and running – which includes selecting and transforming data and selecting an algorithm. For fast prototyping, keep things simple and just try your luck with a log. regression or a decision tree. Also, consider complementing your prototype by a click dummy. What works, what does not? Let’s evaluate the performance of your prototype and run tests. Sure, we want to evaluate the performance of the ML model that we trained – for instance with test data or with live testing. But, also think about running the user through the experience and get the feedback. We don’t want to get too nerdy too soon, right? Because we may miss out some learning. With the feedback of the users, you may refine and tune your algorithm to perform better and create a more integrated as well as pleasant experience. You should seek to understand what features had the most impact on the perceived value of your product.

I really enjoyed insightful analytics and I was thrilled by the idea of having an impact on how people would make sense of complex matter. More than a computer nerd, I’m rather a business guy trained at Econometrics, Marketing Research and Innovation Management. Lured by the promises of how data may change the way businesses made money in the future, I engaged into the field of Data Science. I learned coding algorithms and the backbones of Data Engineering to get leveled up in Machine Learning and other miraculous data witch craft. I’m curious by nature, so it was great fun. One year ago, I got hired by a big company with even bigger data. Among other data, the company handled transaction data on the pharmaceutical market at extensive volume. What would you want to do with such data? Well, you can look into trends, cycles, exports, imports, launches, networks, consumption behavior, data gaps, quality issues, etc. Perfect, I thought to myself, I can crack that. So I started.

And we’re endlessly trying to make sense of it. We write wikis, documentations, and often overwrite past knowledge. We compose process flows and algorithms, and often redesign some legacy system. We collect and process data, and often clean, transform, or overthrow the sample. Now, as you start into your new job, all kinds of documents, systems and data sets will be introduced to you. This is a very vital phase for the upcoming days and weeks. Absorb all information, be curious, ask questions and take a ton of notes. Very probable that you may need to go through catalogs of data set description, fish in the deep seas of database systems, and decipher some legacy process flow and code. This is the point where you can shine with your skills in data exploration. This basis work will allow for a correct interpretation of the result and a correct composition of a new ML work flow that you may have been tasked with. Again, this is a very vital exercise. In fact, it is an exercise that would repeat itself over and over again with any new project that you’d be introduced to.

Accoording to Gartner’s Data Science Team Survey (2018), over 60% of Machine Learning models never actually went to production. With this fairly new technology, gaps between Dev and Ops may hinder a swift deployment of your ML master work. To have the right infrastructure at hand sounds as obvious as it may be hard to realize, if it is not in place. Too often at the beginning of a project and in mostly all cases driven by the business guys, we underestimate the technical dept in ML systems. ML code may be a driver of the products value proposition. Yet, it actually is a tiny puzzle piece in a much larger and more complex platform of complementary elements. See this propular article on the technical dept in ML: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf So what you may want to start out with is a good understanding of your pipelines (batch size / stream, quality, format, anything). And what you may want to avoid is that your ML flow becomes a bottleneck in the system. Therefore, optimize your pipeline, for instance by downsizing data samples, running parallel processes, setting up virtual environments, etc. Make anything work to support the rule of flow: increase # of shipped products per time units in your bottleneck. And, as usual, make sure to allow for feedback to your flow and reduce the amount of unplanned work if adhoc changes are required. You know that you are on a good path if your code iterate multiple versions of prototypes on your production system every day.

And here the trouble is on: how to design an appropriate representation of your results? To be honest with you, the first presentation of results I held was a total mess. I have had far too many visualizations prepared. I was jumping back and forth between the graphs and data tables. On top of it, I was pacing too fast assuming that the audience may follow me easily. Well, not so much. After 30 Minutes, the room was full of confusion and we needed to start over again. Since that meeting, I searched for some techniques to help me get my messages communicated in an effective as well as efficient way. At first, I split my results in a report (usual framework of academical writing), input and output data as well as my code, and the representation of my result that support the story of the presentation. I only present the latter and send out the report and data after the meeting together with my meeting minutes. The approach of the Minto pyramid (or SCQA) helped me to structure my talk better and carefully guide the attention and cognitive processes of the audience. By today, it became a routine to frame messages, focus on the crucial points, allow people to zone out a bit, and take breaks before getting to the most important matter. To help your story line even more, you may want to go for one anchor visualization that can carry a really heavy load of information. If you possibly can, design a physical replication of your data so that people can actually touch, feel and play with your results. For instance, you can use a big canvas and cut out some paper or you can play with some Lego. It may sound weird to go back from digital to analog. But, a tangible experience is just easier to process then a pure virtual or theoretical idea. Your audience will be grateful.

Taking data privacy and security into the equation, the flow combines Mkt + Dev + Ops + Sec (which is a little more extensive than the currently popular DevOps view on things). Being a data scientist makes you standing at the center of that flow and being a crucial point of contact and interest. Better be aware of all the nice attention. And, better ramp up your communication and persuasion skills – not least for turning down some less productive requests. In order to be a true team player, the role requires you to understand how all the different departments work together. Plus, you should know how these are organized and what drives their successes.
