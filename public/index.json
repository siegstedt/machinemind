Conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages. So, it covers a wider range functoinality. Well, there are other tools that you could use. Fair point. The above mentioned package manager pip. Or, the environment manager virtualenv.

Thank you for your help. Disclaimer: In this list, all books are publicly available, which is fortunate. With my reading lists, I’m generally trying to include as many open source books as I can. Please bear with me or the authors if that cannot be arranged with every item of my lists. Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents, 2nd Edition by David L. Poole and Alan K. Mackworth (September 2017, 820 pages). https://artint.info/2e/html/ArtInt2e.html My comment: Great framework on the foundations of AI, or “Computational Agents” as it’s referred to in the book. It’s a good choice to get started and understand the bigger picture of AI. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, 2nd edition (corrected) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman (January 2017, 764 pages). https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf My comment: Okay, look. The book covers supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees, boosting, graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. You see? Machine Learning Yearning: Technical Strategy for AI Engineers, In the Era of Deep Learning by Andrew Ng (2018, 118 pages). https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/ My comment: If you’re interested in how to make Machine Learning work, Andrew Ng will teach you. I found it particularly valuable to learn how to set up end-to-end ML projects and make sense of its outcomes. Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (November 2016, 800 pages). http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ My comment: Indisputably, this is a key resource for learning about deep learning. The book uncovers paths to mastering deep learning with comprehensive mathematical and conceptual coverage on various methods. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, 2nd edition by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (November 2018, 548 pages). http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf My comment: Besides deep learning, reinforcement learning is a big topic in AI. This introductory piece will get you up to speed with the methodology and its use. The Essential AI Handbook for Leaders by Peltarion (59 pages). http://pages.peltarion.com/rs/842-GTD-459/images/AI-handbook-desktop-PDF.pdf My comment: This is the one and only non-technical book in the list. It focuses more on how to lead the change in our social and business communities. Noteworthy, the book provides an AI checklist for comparing yourself against AI readiness. And that’s it. As you have observed, the reading list was condensed to a set of six books. That may appear a little unfair to the hundreds or thousands of other very well-crafted publications. Due to the effects of selective attention, I wanted to focus on the most relevant. What’s your must read? I may even have missed it. Please let me know.

In this time of rapid innovation and the need for expert knowledge, it’s a tough call to be a master in all disciplines. Be it algorithm designs, project management, product design, you name it. It’s truly hard to span an umbrella to cover it all and still make it simple to follow through and produce effective results. Here is what I’d do: Blend Data Science into Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a repeatable and scalable process for innovation. It is meant for designing products in a human-centered way. Typically, the Design Thinking flow starts within the problem space where one seeks to understand and frame the user’s perspective of the problem. With a well-defined problem statement, Design Thinkers brainstorm on how to solve it before the flow continues into the solution space. In that space, it’s all about prototyping and playing back the output to the user to receive feedback. In Data Science, typically algorithms are trained to iteratively learn from data. This process is called Machine Learning and allows machines to find insights with or without explicit instruction where to look for the same. A project for applying Machine Learning typically starts with a problem definition, some provided data and a manual solution. After a exploratory data analysis, a Data Scientist would start to prepare the data so that it can be used for a selected algorithm to work on it. Based on the evaluation of results, the algorithm can be tuned. To recap, Design Thinking is a human-centered process that focuses on the problem of users and can be applied to solve any fuzzy problem. Data Science is a data-centered discipline that is home to any domain (or problem space) and uses methods such as Machine Learning to solve decision-making tasks carried out by a computer. Now that we understand that the one has it’s strength in the problem space and the other in the solution space, let’s bring the two together. The diagram below provides an overview of a process that flows through five stages allowing for iterations and repetition.

The Setup is centered around picking up an opportunity, assemble the crew and calling out the direction where to go. A good opportunity might be a process that consists of small, repetitive tasks that are not too complicated for a human to do once but tough to repeat at high volume and high precision. There maybe an experienced / specialized person doing the job manually. And that is the start of most of our use cases. Too often we expect humans to work like assembly line robots. And we do not create systems to assist the humans so that they can unfold their creative and social capacities.

Hold your keyboards still though – this is a non-coding area. First, one tries to zoom out and discover the full complexity and explore depth of the challenge at hand. In an effort to empathize with the user, you can hold interviews with customers, business units and teams. You can also look into some data begin to understand the flow of information and decision-making. As you want to bring your observations into structure, you define the problem. This might seam odd because you’d assume to know the problem. Yet, practice shows that a thorough discovery may bring to light new insights that are often reason to redefine or refine the initial understanding of the problem. So, how might we turn this into knowledge into a new product? Let’s ideate and envision a new future. In this step, you can run crazy and be truly creative. Tools such as value proposition canvases can help to structure crazy ideas into abstract product prototypes. For data-centered work, you may use a canvases with similar themes, e.g. ML / DL canvas.

Actually, this step may be placed at any start, respectively end of a space / loop. It ensures that you are not wasting your time and take decisions. Because, you should be be hard on your project and rather stop it sooner than later. Get your team together and pessimistically ask yourselves why this might fail and only keep going once all (technical) objections are met with a reasonable clue. If the team is happy with the project, give the project a go and let it pass to the subsequent stage. This decision should not be taking lightly. Ask yourselves whether you are really still fulfilling against the aspired vision. If you want to abandon the previous efforts to make a concerted effort towards a new option or idea, pivot the process. Lessons may be learned from the old project, and parts may be salvaged and re-purposed.

Finally, we can start hammering our fingers on the keyboards to produce ML code. Before you start building any system, invest a little time into planning out the sprints and translate the prototypes into a backlog of user stories. Get your ML model up and running – which includes selecting and transforming data and selecting an algorithm. For fast prototyping, keep things simple and just try your luck with a log. regression or a decision tree. Also, consider complementing your prototype by a click dummy. What works, what does not? Let’s evaluate the performance of your prototype and run tests. Sure, we want to evaluate the performance of the ML model that we trained – for instance with test data or with live testing. But, also think about running the user through the experience and get the feedback. We don’t want to get too nerdy too soon, right? Because we may miss out some learning. With the feedback of the users, you may refine and tune your algorithm to perform better and create a more integrated as well as pleasant experience. You should seek to understand what features had the most impact on the perceived value of your product.

More than a computer nerd, I’m rather a business guy trained at Econometrics, Marketing Research and Innovation Management. Lured by the promises of how data may change the way businesses made money in the future, I engaged into the field of Data Science. I learned coding algorithms and the backbones of Data Engineering to get leveled up in Machine Learning and other miraculous data witch craft. I’m curious by nature, so it was great fun. One year ago, I got hired by a big company with even bigger data. Among other data, the company handled transaction data on the pharmaceutical market at extensive volume. What would you want to do with such data? Well, you can look into trends, cycles, exports, imports, launches, networks, consumption behavior, data gaps, quality issues, etc. Perfect, I thought to myself, I can crack that. So I started.

And we’re endlessly trying to make sense of it. We write wikis, documentations, and often overwrite past knowledge. We compose process flows and algorithms, and often redesign some legacy system. We collect and process data, and often clean, transform, or overthrow the sample. Now, as you start into your new job, all kinds of documents, systems and data sets will be introduced to you. This is a very vital phase for the upcoming days and weeks. Absorb all information, be curious, ask questions and take a ton of notes. Very probable that you may need to go through catalogs of data set description, fish in the deep seas of database systems, and decipher some legacy process flow and code. This is the point where you can shine with your skills in data exploration. This basis work will allow for a correct interpretation of the result and a correct composition of a new ML work flow that you may have been tasked with. Again, this is a very vital exercise.

Accoording to Gartner’s Data Science Team Survey (2018), over 60% of Machine Learning models never actually went to production. With this fairly new technology, gaps between Dev and Ops may hinder a swift deployment of your ML master work. To have the right infrastructure at hand sounds as obvious as it may be hard to realize, if it is not in place. Too often at the beginning of a project and in mostly all cases driven by the business guys, we underestimate the technical dept in ML systems. ML code may be a driver of the products value proposition. Yet, it actually is a tiny puzzle piece in a much larger and more complex platform of complementary elements. See this propular article on the technical dept in ML: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf So what you may want to start out with is a good understanding of your pipelines (batch size / stream, quality, format, anything). And what you may want to avoid is that your ML flow becomes a bottleneck in the system. Therefore, optimize your pipeline, for instance by downsizing data samples, running parallel processes, setting up virtual environments, etc. Make anything work to support the rule of flow: increase # of shipped products per time units in your bottleneck. And, as usual, make sure to allow for feedback to your flow and reduce the amount of unplanned work if adhoc changes are required. You know that you are on a good path if your code iterate multiple versions of prototypes on your production system every day.

And here the trouble is on: how to design an appropriate representation of your results? To be honest with you, the first presentation of results I held was a total mess. I have had far too many visualizations prepared. I was jumping back and forth between the graphs and data tables. On top of it, I was pacing too fast assuming that the audience may follow me easily. Well, not so much. After 30 Minutes, the room was full of confusion and we needed to start over again. Since that meeting, I searched for some techniques to help me get my messages communicated in an effective as well as efficient way. At first, I split my results in a report (usual framework of academical writing), input and output data as well as my code, and the representation of my result that support the story of the presentation. I only present the latter and send out the report and data after the meeting together with my meeting minutes. The approach of the Minto pyramid (or SCQA) helped me to structure my talk better and carefully guide the attention and cognitive processes of the audience. By today, it became a routine to frame messages, focus on the crucial points, allow people to zone out a bit, and take breaks before getting to the most important matter. To help your story line even more, you may want to go for one anchor visualization that can carry a really heavy load of information. If you possibly can, design a physical replication of your data so that people can actually touch, feel and play with your results. For instance, you can use a big canvas and cut out some paper or you can play with some Lego. It may sound weird to go back from digital to analog. But, a tangible experience is just easier to process then a pure virtual or theoretical idea. Your audience will be grateful.

It flows from the market research and new product development over to production and delivery to the customer. Taking data privacy and security into the equation, the flow combines Mkt + Dev + Ops + Sec (which is a little more extensive than the currently popular DevOps view on things). Being a data scientist makes you standing at the center of that flow and being a crucial point of contact and interest. Better be aware of all the nice attention. And, better ramp up your communication and persuasion skills – not least for turning down some less productive requests. In order to be a true team player, the role requires you to understand how all the different departments work together. Plus, you should know how these are organized and what drives their successes. During some coffee break or at an introduction meeting, ask your colleagues what they do – like what exactly they produce – and what a good or a bad days looks and feels like for them.

With the use of rule-based system, fraudulent export activities were identified. The project got translated into an offering and won the IQVIA Germany Innovation Award 2020. Operations Control System The project introduced a central data model to systematically monitor workflows spanning over 7 homegrown and third-party production systems. In result, the time gap between production and delivery was decreased by 2-3 days in average through deploying a regression-based prediction model to calculate estimated production cycle time. Further, we saved the organization around 500 emails/calls a month by serving full performance visibility. Likelihood of Innovation Success For the early stage innovation platform, inkubate, I led theoretical research on modelling the likelihood of innovation success based on user input and the design of a data architecture for serving an NLP system to extract 25 features across 4 clusters. Upon the integration of the model into the UX, the project realized an initial funding of USD 200.000 for software development – where I served the first development iterations as Product Owner.
