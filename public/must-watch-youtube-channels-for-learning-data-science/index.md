Help and **contribute** to this list on [GitHub](https://github.com/siegstedt/machinemind/blob/main/content/posts/must-watch-youtube-channels-for-learning-data-science.md). Thank you for your contribution.

**Data School** – https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool
This is a good start if you are a pretty fresh beginner. Data School focuses on the topics you need to master first. Kevin Markham has a great talent to introduce you to Python and it’s Data Science tools stack. Really – go here first, if you want to get started with Data Science in Python.

**StatQuest with Josh Starmer** – https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer
StatQuest is fun. Well, if you like statistics, learning, and some random funny music, then you will enjoy StatQuest. Josh aims at explaining statistical methods in a clear language and animated visuals. His songs and his talk are super entertaining as well as informative.

**3Blue1Brown** – https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw
YoutTube can offer even more funny and educational content on Data Science: 3Blue1Brown. The channel by Grant Sanderson combines math and entertainment. The explanations are driven by animations and difficult problems are made simple.

**sentdex** – https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex
Here is a channel to find a comprehensive package for your career path becoming a Data Scientist with Python. You may enjoy the channel if you want to learn Python programming, Machine Learning, Finance, Data Analysis, Robotics, Web Development, Game Development and more.

**Computerphile** – https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile and/or Numberphile – https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile
Different to the channels above, you would not always find playlists of courses to attain some skill. I rather enjoy watching just to feed your curiosity on topics around computers and statistics.

Let me know any suggestions for other great content for getting an introduction to Data Science related topics on YouTube.

Side note: If you wish to engage more with either of the YouTubers, check their info pages on YouTube. You may find links to home pages, twitter, reddit, facebook or other social media.
