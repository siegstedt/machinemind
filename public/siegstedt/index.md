## So ...

I was born somewhere in Siberia. Grew up in Bavaria. Studied Economics and Management. Worked in Digital Transformation and Data Science. I have love for running, food and DIY.

At heart, I am a creator that loves to fix and solve challenges. I feel that it is exciting to drive business value using innovative ideas as well as a pragmatic work ethos.

Since 2015, I worked as a counsel for analytical inquiries in the fields of Market & Consumer Intelligence, Innovation & Product Management and Software Development.

My professional experience lies the IT and Pharmaceutical industries. I deliver viable products working with agile development teams and give counsel on strategic endeavors in the world of data driven business.
