## Projects

**Pharmaceutical Product Flow Analysis**<br>
Provided with seven sets of transactional data, the project conceptualised a framework to model the flows of pharmaceutical products across a variety of market participants, including ex-factory, wholesale, hospitals and pharmacies. With the use of rule-based system, fraudulent export activities were identified. The project got translated into an offering and won the IQVIA Germany Innovation Award 2020.

**Operations Control System**<br>
The project introduced a central data model to systematically monitor workflows spanning over 7 homegrown and third-party production systems. In result, the time gap between production and delivery was decreased by 2-3 days in average through deploying a regression-based prediction model to calculate estimated production cycle time. Further, we saved the organization around 500 emails/calls a month by serving full performance visibility.

**Likelihood of Innovation Success**<br>
For the early stage innovation platform, inkubate, I led theoretical research on modelling the likelihood of innovation success based on user input and the design of a data architecture for serving an NLP system to extract 25 features across 4 clusters. Upon the integration of the model into the UX, the project realized an initial funding of USD 200.000 for software development – where I served the first development iterations as Product Owner.
